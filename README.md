Say hello to **Multiverse**, a slick, one-page gallery design with a fully functional lightbox.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command        | Action                                       |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install` | Installs dependencies                        |
| `pnpm dev`     | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`  |
| `pnpm build`   | Build your production site to `./dist/`      |
| `pnpm preview` | Preview your build locally, before deploying |

## How it works

You can change your images in `public/images`. After that update list of images in [`images.json`](src/components/images.json). If you want you can use [this tool](https://github.com/AREA44/node-getImages) to genarate a `images.json`.
